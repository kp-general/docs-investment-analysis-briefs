# Section 1: Company Overview

- Headquartered in Arizona, Align Technology (Align) was founded in 1997 by Zia Chishti and Kelsey Wirth (GSB friends). Align is best known for its Invisalign system, which uses clear aligners to straighten teeth.
    - The pair went on to raise USD 140mn from the likes of Kleiner Perkins before going public at a USD 1bn valuation in 2001
    - Kelsey left in November 2001 in order to pursue her interests in the areas of environmental protection and education where she had worked prior to founding Align
    - Zia left shortly after in March 2002. Media accounts suggest that disagreement may have been over corporate strategy (aggressive DTC advertising v. dentist and orthodontist word of mouth)
    - Thomas Prescott (background in healthcare and medical devices) took over as CEO before retiring in 2015 and was replaced Joe Hogan (current CEO)
- The Invisalign system utilizes advanced 3D computer imaging technology to create a series of custom-made aligners that gradually move teeth into the desired position. This method offers a discreet alternative to traditional braces.
- The company is publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol ALGN.

# Section 2: Problems / Opportunities

**Problems** 

1. Traditional orthodontic treatment limitations: Align’s Invisalign system addresses the aesthetic and comfort issues associated with traditional metal braces. It offers a more discreet, removable, and comfortable alternative for teeth straightening.
2. Inefficiencies in dental practice workflows: The iTero intraoral scanners help streamline dental practices by replacing traditional impression methods, reducing chair time, and improving accuracy in treatment planning.
3. Patient engagement and post treatment care: Align’s digital platform and mobile apps enhance patient engagement, potentially improving treatment adherence and outcomes.

**Opportunities**

It is estimated that 60-75% of the world’s population has some form of malocclusion. Invisalign is an alternative to traditional metal braces that is cost comparable and doesn’t sacrifice outer appearance to generate extraordinary results

# Section 6: Key Risks

**Economic sensitivity:** Demand for Invisalign and other clear aligner products may be affected by economic downturns, as consumers might be less willing to spend on elective dental procedures during tough economic times.

**Market saturation**: Although there aren’t that many pure play clear aligner competition left with scale, it is unclear that there is incremental demand for dental aesthetics, especially with flat revenue the past four years.

**Not top of mind**: Unlike acute or chronic illnesses, poor dental hygiene is not discussed as a key factor in lifespan or healthspan conversations. Many see dental procedures as nice to have not need to have.

**Dependency on a single product line**: While Align has diversified somewhat with iTero scanners, a significant portion of its revenue still comes from Invisalign, making it vulnerable to disruptions in this product line.

# Section 7: Comps

**Public**

1. SmileDirectClub (NASDAQ: SDC): One of the most prominent home aligner companies once valued at USD 8.9bn is now bankrupted.
2. Dentsply Sirona (NASDAQ: XRAY): Dentsply Sirona is a large dental equipment manufacturer that has acquired competitors in the clear aligner market, providing products similar to Invisalign.
3. Straumann Group (SWX: STMN): Straumann is another major player in the dental industry, offering clear aligner solutions through its various acquisitions and partnerships.

**Private**

1. Candid: An orthodontic company focusing on clear aligner solutions with remote monitoring by orthodontists.
2. Byte: An orthodontic company offering direct-to-consumer, at-home invisible aligners.
3. 3D Predict: A company using advanced AI technology to create precise treatment plans for teeth alignment.

# Section 8: Further Discussion Points

- Might be a name to keep in mind for deeper dive? No debt, USD 1bn cash balance, flat growth at USD 3.8bn revenue, only publicly traded pure play left
- What are the health benefits of having better teeth?
    - Speech improvement, better digestion, confidence → greater productivity → less depression (look good-feel good-play good-pay good)?
- Do we believe in a future where incremental consumers will invest in themselves? This is the closest thing to a silver bullet that requires absolutely no work and just money (the ozempic of teeth)
- Does the company’s IP portfolio contribute to their dominance or is the brand recognition more nuanced like customer preference?

# Section 10: Feedback

- Tim’s good friend is CEO/CFO(?) of Zenyum
    - https://zenyum.sg/?srsltid=AfmBOoqY0uVSjH0m1k1qSg4aVmTd835vOswds-05a7sIryyVidYiK6m9
- Tim/Tee’s dentist — Caroline Goh — design and layout of jaw structure is important
- Look further into how this topic (poor dental health/bad teeth/jaw) links to healthspan and lifespan > does it link to heart disease, diabetes, neurogenerative diseases?
- Shift from isolate systems thinking to collective systems thinking — one thing often drags down other components of a system
    - perform factor analysis that contributes — e.g. how much of my Alzheimers comes from a dental thing vs something else — would be cool if possible
- Dental health might be under-rated and no one really talks about it
- A crammed jaw can have trickle down effects on neck pains, migraines, etc.
