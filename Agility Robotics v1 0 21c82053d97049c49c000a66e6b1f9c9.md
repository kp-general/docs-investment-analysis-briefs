# Section 1: Company Overview

**About the Company**

Founded in 2015 and headquartered in Oregon, Agility Robotics’ mission is to build robot partners that augment the human workforce. Agility Robotics' flagship product is **Digit —** it is designed to work alongside humans to tackle material movement tasks in logistics and manufacturing environments (i.e., warehouses and factories). This versatile robot can lift, sort, and maneuver objects while navigating complex environments, including stairs and tight spaces.

Agility Robotics combines artificial intelligence, including reinforcement learning and generative AI models, with innovative physical design. This approach creates robots that are both physically capable and intelligently adaptable. Agility Robotics has also developed *Agility Arc*, a cloud automation platform specifically designed to manage Digit workflows. This platform simplifies the design, commissioning, operation, and support of robot fleets.

By developing these advanced robotic solutions, Agility Robotics aims to empower businesses in logistics and manufacturing to address labor challenges and achieve greater operational efficiency.

**Leadership** 

Over the past three months, Agility has made several changes to its leadership team

- In May 2023, Co-founder Jonathan Hurst transitioned to Chief Robot Officer (he was previously Chief Technology Officer).
    - According to Hurst’s Linkedin, he will play a similar role although his title has changed.
- On 4 March 2024, Agility appointed Peggy Johnson as Chief Executive Officer.
    - Co-founder Damion Shelton, who has served as CEO since the company’s inception will transition to the role of President, and remain a part of Johnson’s leadership team.
    - It was vaguely mentioned that Shelton brought in Johnson to help the company transition toward commercialization.
- On 15 May 2024, Agility added/promoted the following personnel:
    - Appointed Daniel Diez as Chief Strategy Officer.
    - Appointed Melonee Wise as Chief Product Officer (she was previously its Chief Technology Officer).
    - Promoted Pras Velagapuidi to Chief Technology Officer (he was previously Chief Architect / VP of Innovation).

**Funds Raised**

- March 2018 — raised a [USD8mn round](https://agilityrobotics.com/content/agility-robotics-secures-8m-in-funding-to-enable-robotic-legged-locomotion-in-the-real-world) led by Playground Global, Sony Innovation Fund, Robotics Hub.
- October 2020 — raised a [USD20mn round](https://agilityrobotics.com/content/agility-robotics-rasies-20-million) led by DCVC and Playground Global.
    - Other investors include MFV Partners, TDK Ventures, ITIC, Sony Innovation Fund, and Safar Partners
- April 2022 — raised a U[SD150mn Series B round](https://agilityrobotics.com/content/agility-robotics-raises-series-b) led by DCVC and Playground Global. This capital raise will accelerate Agility’s R&D and scale its robot production.
    - The Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund also joined as an investor to help spur innovation in the logistics industry.
- While Agility is not explicitly looking to raise at the moment, the company says the possibility is always on the table. CEO Johnson cited [Figure’s](https://www.figure.ai/) recent USD2.6bn valuation and noted that “*All boats rise with those kinds of headlines, and we will certainly leverage that*.”

# Section 10: Feedback

- One of the biggest OPEX for warehousing companies is labor cost. If you replace humans with robots, it becomes an asset heavy business vs OPEX heavy. This means you need more cash to transition, fund flow changes and it becomes a lower cost, higher asset business.
- How would these companies manage economic downturns when a lot of technology capex has been put in.
- Why the obsession with humanoid aesthetic? Companies are catering robots to current infrastructure. The future may have the opposite where infrastructure is built around robots and robotic warehouses
- Divergence into industry specific functions
